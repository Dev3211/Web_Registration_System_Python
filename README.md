# Web_Registration_System_Python

Web registration system written in Python using the module Flask for learning purposes, for now it only supports username, password and inserts bcrypt hash but you can add more fields as well. I also added recaptcha validation and some validation checks to make the register secure. The app runs on the port 5000 and accepts any connections as the host is set to 0.0.0.0, that can be changed by changing the settings in init.py

Modules required:
Flask
flask-bcrypt
flash-recaptcha

Enjoy the script as it's pretty much easy and simple to use.
